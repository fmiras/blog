Let's start with the basics, what's **Open Banking**? Why am I hearing this all the time? Is it going to affect me at all?

There is no clear description nor definition for Open Banking, but I'd say that is a movement, ideology, and trend that involves you, as a user, being the owner of your banking data (and even more!). What does this mean? Well, you're not going to actually have each byte of data in a USB flash drive of yourself, I wouldn't be practical at all, at least not yet. But it actually allows you to use this information and also share it with your favorite apps or even other banks!

Let me go with you throw this idea to a deeper level, let's say that you're a simple savings bank account owner in a bank entity called "Bank A". Bank A did a lot of data collecting over the years from your credit card transactions to your payroll transfers and a lot of metadata of them as well, such as the location where you make that credit card purchases or the company that is paying you your salaries. You might not even know that they have this information, the first step would be to acknowledge that it exists and it has a lot of value to offer, value for you and value for a whole new industry.

How is that having ownership of this data, and the ability to share it to whatever app you want, gives you value? Let's review some examples:

**Personal Finances**: Applications like [Mint](https://www.mint.com), that makes easier the management and consolidation of your finances, give you vision in your spending, your incomes, help you with better tools to learn and improve your savings, allowing you to invest and control your financial assets.

**Lending**: The ability of people to take loans to create new businesses, hire people, and bring new products or services to improve life quality to society is one of the pillars of great economies. The problem is when companies don't know much about the people that want credit and because of risk calculations, they prefer not to borrow if is not safe enough. Usually, they need access to regulated databases that are not open for everybody and this removes supply for the big demand there is in the market. With Open Banking individuals are able to control who of these entities access their data to improve their risk-related scoring and get better interests, more cash, more to work on. I'll leave this topic for a whole separate article.

**Proptech**: In LATAM, renting an apartment can be a pain in the ass, since they ask you a lot of paperwork (in Argentina they even ask you your last 3 payroll receipts!), warranties, and also a deposit to ensure that nothing is going wrong in case you don't pay. With OB, we can re-create this business why allowing people to connect their bank account so companies can do a retroactive analysis and check their salary by themselves, solvency, left to spend after incomes-expenses, all automatically. As same as lending, companies can create a financial profile of you to offer better or more accurate services.

**Banking**: This may be one of the firsts ones we're going to see. Since digital banks are 100% focused on offering a better service for users, they usually stand in favor of Open Banking. This will enable users the ability to share their financial history freely between banks, they will gain new features just as using the same user interface for all their different accounts and banks are able to offer better product based on a more accurate profile of the user. For example, I can get a free platinum credit card if the bank "discovers" that I have the same plan with another entity. Competition between banks is going up! And we as users, get benefits from this.

**KYC (Know Your Customer)**: It has never been easier to actually accomplish a whole KYC process by just connecting a bank account. Risk analysis engines are going to be able to determine if an account is fraudulent or not plus the fact that it's going to check bank account owner full name, ID and personal details.

There are a lot more use cases I could write about, and every day new ones are still being created. The point is that Open Banking is a necessary step for the next level of a hyperconnected world.

**Conclusion**: OB is not only going to show prettier charts or just move our home banking numbers to another good looking app but also is going to allow us to save, invest, and grow our personal economy maybe. The same way we all today have a personal cloud where we store videos, photos, and documents, something that in the past only was possible for big companies, we're now going to have our own database of finances and a great suite of applications that will help with our decision making with the same intelligence as a Fortune 500 company does.
